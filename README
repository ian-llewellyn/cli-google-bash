CLI Google Bash
===============
by Ian Llewellyn


What is cli-google-bash?
------------------------

I wanted an easy way to do searches from the bash command line while
working on Linux. Usually I would load elinks, then Go to
www.google.ie, highlight the search box, type what I wanted to find
and finally hit return. This short bash script skips over a few of
these steps.


How to install
--------------

It's up to you how you implement it. I just put the google script
into my ~/bin directory and made sure it was in my $PATH.


How to use
----------

From the command line, I just type:
$ google what I want to find
